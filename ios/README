Introduction
------------

This is mono-fork for iOS which can built and run on the Mac OS X.
That includes mono cross-compiller and static mono lib building scripts.
For using mono on iOS you can only use full-aot static compillation.

Requirements
------------

For building my C# sample you need MonoDevelop.
For building iOS-app sample you need 
	* Apple Develop Program membership
	* XCode
	* iOS SDK

Also you need install Mono Runtime 4.0 dlls (gac + mscorlib.dll) into
/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/lib/mono

Instructions
------------
1. If this is a clean checkout, you may need to do this from /path/to/mono:
	./autogen.sh --enable-nls=no && make distclean

2. Run ./ios-install-all.sh to install:
	* iOS Mono AOT compiler (ios-mono)
	* iOS Mono static lib (ios-runtime-mono)

3. For full-aot compilation gac and mscorlib.dll run:
	cd test/BuildScripts
	./aotGac.sh
	./aotMscorlib.sh

4. For building (assembly + full-aot) MonoTest.dll sample open and rebuild MonoTest/MonoTest.sln with MonoDevelop.

5. For building and runing sample iOS-app use XCode-project iOSMonoTest/iOSMonoTest.xcodeproj.
